// Since the original code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses variables like 'brevity', 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and' without declaration or import.
// Without the original code, I can only provide a placeholder solution that declares these variables.
// A proper solution would require the original code to determine the correct type and usage of these variables.

const brevity = "placeholder"
const it = "placeholder"
const is = "placeholder"
const correct = "placeholder"
const and = "placeholder"

// The rest of the original code would go here, presumably using the above variables.
// For example:
// console.log(brevity, it, is, correct, and);

// This is a placeholder to represent the original code.
// In a real scenario, this would be replaced with the actual content of the original file.
